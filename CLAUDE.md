# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Flashcut is a client-side-only SPA for flashcard learning with FSRS spaced repetition. SolidJS **2.0 beta** + Tailwind CSS v4, data stored in a SQLite database running in the browser (Turso WASM, persisted in OPFS). No backend.

## Solid 2.0 beta conventions

This repo uses Solid 2.0 (`solid-js@next`, `@solidjs/web`, `@solidjs/router@next`, `vite-plugin-solid@next`) — do NOT use 1.x APIs:

- Async data: `createMemo(async () => …)` (reads suspend under `<Loading>`), NOT `createResource`. Invalidate with `refresh(memo)` after mutations, not `refetch`.
- Boundaries: `<Loading>` (was Suspense) and `<Errored>` (was ErrorBoundary; fallback gets `(err: () => unknown, reset)` — err is an accessor).
- Lifecycle: `onSettled(() => { …; return cleanup })` (was onMount). Split-effect form: `createEffect(compute, apply)`.
- Batching: setters don't update reads until the microtask flush; never read a signal right after setting it expecting the new value (use `flush()` in tests only).
- `render` comes from `@solidjs/web` (not `solid-js/web`); `jsxImportSource` is `@solidjs/web` (tsconfig.app.json).
- `src/router-jsx-compat.d.ts` shims the router's stale JSX types (`<A class=…>`); remove once @solidjs/router ships @solidjs/web-based types.
- Renames if needed later: `mergeProps`→`merge`, `splitProps`→`omit`, `unwrap`→`snapshot`, store setters are draft-first (produce-style).

## Commands

Always use **pnpm** (never npm/npx; use `pnpm dlx` instead of npx).

- `pnpm dev` — dev server
- `pnpm build` — typecheck (`tsc -b`) + production build
- `pnpm preview` — serve the production build
- `pnpm test` — run all tests (Vitest, Node environment)
- `pnpm vitest run src/db/repositories.test.ts` — run a single test file
- `pnpm typecheck` — typecheck only
- `pnpm test:pwa` — build, then verify offline PWA behavior in headless Chromium (`scripts/pwa-smoke.mjs`)
- `pnpm icons` — regenerate the `public/` PNG icon set from `public/favicon.svg`

## Architecture

**Storage:** `@tursodatabase/database-wasm` — SQLite in the browser, persisted in OPFS. It needs SharedArrayBuffer, so COOP/COEP headers are mandatory in dev AND production (`vite.config.ts` sets them for dev/preview; `public/_headers` for Netlify/Cloudflare; plain GitHub Pages cannot host this app). Multiple tabs work via leader election: one tab acquires a Web Lock (`navigator.locks`), opens the real database, and serves all other tabs over a BroadcastChannel RPC (`src/lib/broadcast-service.ts`, crackle-style proxy with correlation ids — BroadcastChannel cannot transfer MessagePorts). Followers are promoted automatically when the leader closes. Import from `@tursodatabase/database-wasm/vite` (dev-server workaround baked into the export map).

**Layering** (UI → db, with srs as pure functions in between):

- `src/db/client.ts` — leader election + `DbService` (exec/run/get/all/exportFile/importFile). `getDb()` returns a `DbConnection` that dispatches locally on the leader and proxies on followers; only the leader runs migrations and may close the database. File export/import goes through `dbService`, never raw OPFS access from followers.
- `src/db/migrations.ts` — append-only SQL migrations, tracked via `PRAGMA user_version`. Cascading deletes happen in repository code, not via FK enforcement.
- `src/db/{decks,cards,reviews}.ts` — repository functions. All take a `DbConnection` parameter so tests can inject `@tursodatabase/database` (the Node build with an identical async API — this is why tests run in plain Node, no browser needed).
- `src/srs/` — ts-fsrs wrapper. `mapping.ts` is the ONLY place that converts between ts-fsrs `Date`s, stored ISO strings, and `Temporal` — keep it that way.
- `src/pages/` — one lazy-loaded component per route (routes defined in `src/index.tsx`).
- `src/lib/broadcast.ts` — typed cross-tab change events (`Decks/Cards/Reviews changed`) + `useBroadcast` hook. After a mutation, pages call `refresh(...)` locally AND `broadcastMessage(...)` for other tabs (a poster never receives its own broadcast). StudyPage deliberately only emits — its session queue must stay stable.
- `src/lib/deck-json.ts`, `src/lib/db-file.ts` — deck JSON import/export and raw SQLite file export/import (checkpoint WAL + close connection before touching the OPFS file).

**Dates/times:** use the `Temporal` API, never `Date` (except inside `src/srs/mapping.ts` at the ts-fsrs boundary). `src/index.tsx` conditionally loads `temporal-polyfill` as a separate chunk; `src/test-setup.ts` does the same for tests. All stored timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC with exactly 3 fractional digits (`lib/time.ts#toIso`) — SQL compares them as strings, so a mixed precision silently breaks ordering.

**FSRS state** lives as columns on `cards` (mirroring the ts-fsrs `Card` type) and `review_logs` (mirroring `ReviewLog`). `State.New` (0) marks unstudied cards; the study queue serves due cards first, then new ones.

**Styling:** Tailwind v4 (CSS-first config in `src/index.css`). Components use `dark:` utilities; the `dark` custom variant resolves to the system preference by default, overridden when `data-color-scheme` is pinned on `<html>`. The same resolution drives the CSS `color-scheme` property (`:root { color-scheme: light dark }` + data-attribute overrides) so native UI matches. `src/stores/color-scheme.ts` manages the setting (`system`/`light`/`dark`, persisted to localStorage under `color-scheme`; an inline script in `index.html` applies a pinned scheme pre-render). Font size works the same way: `src/stores/font-size.ts` sets `data-font-size`, which selects a `--font-scale` applied to the root font-size. Reusable component classes (`btn-primary`, `btn-ghost`, `btn-danger`, `input`, `card`, `nav-link`, `grade-btn`) are defined with `@apply` in `@layer components` in `src/index.css`; utilities override them, so variations are written as e.g. `class="btn-primary w-full py-4"`. State-dependent styling uses data/aria attributes with Tailwind variants (`data-grade`, `aria-current`), not JS-composed class strings.

**Dialogs/popovers:** native `<dialog>` and `[popover]`, opened/closed declaratively with Invoker Commands (`<button commandfor=… command="show-modal"/"close"/"hide-popover">`) — no manual `showModal()` calls in click handlers. Confirmations use `src/components/ConfirmDialog.tsx` (never `window.confirm`); lists share one dialog and stash the pending item in a signal set by the invoker button's `onClick`. Toasts are `popover="manual"` (top layer). `invokers-polyfill` is loaded conditionally in `src/index.tsx` (own chunk, only when `commandForElement` is missing), same pattern as temporal-polyfill; `closedby="any"` light dismiss has a click-coordinate fallback in ConfirmDialog for Safari.

**Markdown:** card fronts/backs are markdown, rendered by `src/components/Markdown.tsx` via marked + DOMPurify. Never render card content with raw `innerHTML` without sanitizing.

**PWA:** `vite-plugin-pwa` (Workbox `generateSW`) precaches the entire build — including the ~9 MB Turso WASM (`maximumFileSizeToCacheInBytes` is raised for it; Workbox's 2 MB default would silently drop it and break offline) and the starter decks. Updates are `registerType: "prompt"`, never auto-reload: `src/stores/sw-update.ts` registers the SW (no-op in dev), polls for updates hourly + on tab visibility, and exposes signals consumed by the toast in `App.tsx` and the "Check for updates" button in Settings. Cache-served responses keep their COOP/COEP headers, which is what keeps `crossOriginIsolated` true offline — `pnpm test:pwa` asserts this, and `src/pwa-precache.test.ts` asserts nothing falls out of the precache manifest (needs a prior build; skips without `dist/`). `public/_headers` serves `sw.js`/manifest with `no-cache` so updates propagate immediately. Typecheck is split into three projects: app (browser types), node (vite config), test (`tsconfig.test.json`, Node + DOM types for `src/**/*.test.ts`).
